# Happiness-Health-Money
You are an evil tyrannical (but small) company that does not suffer from any regulations. However, you are unfortunetely forced keep your employee's mental and physical healths up to continue making those sweet, sweet profits. Be careful though, as you don't want you employee's to be too happy. Let's see how long you last, as one thing's for certain: You will surely fail.

## How to play
Download `index.html` and `script.js` and put them in the same directory, then open index.html. Start clicking buttons and changing sliders to see what happens.

## Inspiration
I thought of managing the health of something, and I thought of a game where you manage the health of 100 employees. It seemed like a fun idea at the time, and turned out to become a fun game.

## What it does
In this game, you play as a company that cares only about profits, but you are forced to manage the mental and physical healths of your employees so they can continue generating profits for you. If you fail at this task, your employees will either die, become depressed and overthrow you, or become too happy for you to contain. The result is a frantic scramble to monitor your employees healths while generating as much profit as possible.

The game runs on a loop where it constantly update the employees. You have the ability to control the following:
- At what point do you consider the health of the employees low enough to let them go home
- How much propaganda you want to use to slow the constant decline of the company
- How much do you want to pay to heal the employees that are close to death and won't recover on their own
- How much do you want to pay for therapy for your depressed employees (don't look at me! It wasn't **my** fault)

The game will get faster and faster, and won't ever stop getting faster. Eventually, you won't have time to click the propaganda button, or you'll simply forget to do it in the madness of the simulation.

## How we built it
As the game would be simple, I went for a simple html and javascript website, with javascript for the functionality and html for the looks. Partway through, I teamed up with Solomon so we could separate the tasks of frontend and backend.

## Challenges we ran into
There were no serious technical challenges and because the game was limited in scope and we had two people to work on it, there was no serious time pressure. In other words, it was smooth sailing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is the first game/project that I (Nick) am proud of, because it is finished and fun to play. Working with a partner just made the entire experience more enjoyable.

## What we learned
For me (Nick), it is my first hackathon, so I learned how to:
- Quickly come up with an idea that I want to follow
- Code under time pressure
- Work with a teammate to finish the project faster and delegate subtasks appropriately
- Participate in a mega-awesome hackathon!

## What's next for Happiness-Health-Money
The code should be optimized on the backend to prevent race conditions with the frontend and other bugs. Other stats can be included in the game, such as trauma (solved by brainwashing), harshness (how hard the employees work, can be solved with brutal intervention), and more to go absolutely bonkers with the amount of data the player has to process.
